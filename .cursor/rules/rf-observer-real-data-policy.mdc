# CRITICAL: Real Data Policy for RF Observer

## ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY POLICY

**RF Observer must always use REAL DATA from ACTUAL HARDWARE.**

Simulation and mock services are strictly prohibited in this project. This policy applies without exception across all components of the system.

## Implementation Requirements

1. All SDR interfaces must connect to and use data from physically connected hardware
2. No simulated signal generation is permitted
3. No hardcoded/static device listings
4. FFT processing must be performed on actual RF samples
5. Waterfall displays must show real-time signal data from physical devices
6. Burst detection must operate on genuine signal captures

## Technical Implementation

- Use pyrtlsdr and SoapySDR to directly access hardware
- Implement proper device enumeration using USB interfaces
- Process actual IQ samples for visualization
- Capture real RF bursts for analysis
- Connect to physical SDR hardware for all signal processing

## Testing Considerations

For development and testing purposes:
- Maintain a collection of pre-recorded IQ files from real hardware
- Use replay mechanisms that use these real recordings
- Never generate artificial data

## Documentation

Implementation notes and diagrams should reflect the use of real hardware throughout the system. Any testing procedures must document how real data is being used, even in automated testing environments.
