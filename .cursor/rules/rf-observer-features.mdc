# RF Observer Feature Guide

This rule outlines the key features of the RF Observer platform.

## Signal Detection & Analysis

- Configurable frequency range scanning
- Real-time FFT and dBFS detection
- Signal threshold and burst duration settings
- Automatic logging with timestamp, frequency, and power data
- Burst clustering by frequency and periodicity

## IQ Capabilities

- Automatic IQ recording of detected signal bursts
- Manual recording controls via UI
- Tagging and metadata storage
- Export formats: `.bin`, `.wav`, `.sigmf`, `.json`
- Signal replay (future HackRF TX support)

## Visualization

- Real-time FFT visualization
- Waterfall displays (WebGL-based)
- Spectrogram viewer
- Power-over-time analysis
- Dashboard widgets for frequency usage

## WebSocket Data Streaming

- Live push of detected bursts
- Device health monitoring
- IQ status updates
- FFT data streaming for spectrum plotting
- Waterfall frame updates

## Planned Audio Features

According to [docs/implementation_roadmap.md](mdc:docs/implementation_roadmap.md):
- Audio streaming from rtl_fm command
- FM demodulation parameter configuration (WFM, NFM, AM)
- Audio transcoding pipeline using ffmpeg/SoX
- HTML5 audio player component
- Modulation selector UI (WFM, NFM, AM)
- Volume controls and frequency fine-tuning

## AI & ML Integration (Future)

- TensorFlow/PyTorch model integration
- Modulation classification (OOK, FSK, etc.)
- Optional LLM assistant for signal summarization
- Pretrained CNN support

## User Workspace

- Signal tagging and annotation
- Custom protocol templates
- Exportable workspaces
- Multi-user support (future)

## Implementation Status
