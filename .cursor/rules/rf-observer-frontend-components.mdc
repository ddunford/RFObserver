# RF Observer Frontend Components

This rule outlines the key frontend components and their implementation in the RF Observer project.

## Component Architecture

The frontend is built with React and employs a component-based architecture with the following main sections:

### Core UI Components

- **Dashboard**: Main application view with control panels and visualizations
- **DeviceSelector**: Dropdown component for selecting RTL-SDR devices
- **FrequencyControls**: Input and validation for frequency selection
- **GainControls**: Sliders and inputs for SDR gain settings
- **SpectrumDisplay**: Real-time FFT visualization using Plotly.js
- **WaterfallDisplay**: Time-series frequency heatmap visualization
- **BurstBrowser**: Interface for viewing and managing detected signal bursts

### Planned Audio Components

- **AudioPlayer**: HTML5 audio player for demodulated signals
- **ModulationSelector**: Controls for selecting modulation type (WFM, NFM, AM)
- **VolumeControls**: Audio volume adjustment sliders
- **AudioIndicator**: Visual indicator of audio signal strength

## State Management

- React Context API for application-wide state
- Socket.io connection management through custom hooks
- Device configuration state with persistence
- FFT data buffering for visualization

## Real-time Data Flow

1. **Socket Connection**: Established on component mount
2. **Device Selection**: Triggers subscription to device-specific FFT data
3. **FFT Data Processing**: Throttled to maintain UI performance
4. **Visualization Rendering**: Optimized for minimum frame drops
5. **Burst Detection**: UI updates triggered by WebSocket events

## UI Layout

See the detailed layout specifications in [rf-observer-ui-design](mdc:.cursor/rules/rf-observer-ui-design.mdc).

## Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- Breakpoints for different device sizes:
  - Small: Phone (< 640px)
  - Medium: Tablet (640px - 1024px)
  - Large: Desktop (> 1024px)
- Collapsible panels for limited screen real estate

## Implementation Status

Current components implemented:
- ✅ Dashboard layout
- ✅ Device selection
- ✅ Frequency controls
- ✅ Gain settings
- ✅ Spectrum display
- ✅ Waterfall visualization
- ✅ Burst detection notifications

Pending implementation:
- ❌ Audio player
- ❌ Modulation selector
- ❌ Audio controls

See [docs/implementation_roadmap.md](mdc:docs/implementation_roadmap.md) for the timeline of remaining component development.
