# RF Observer Project Overview

RF Observer is a modular, web-based RF scanning, signal detection, and protocol analysis platform using SDR devices.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS + socket.io-client + plotly.js
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) + pyrtlsdr + socket.io (asyncio) + numpy/scipy
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers with optional nginx reverse proxy
- **Storage**: File-based storage for IQ files + SQLite/PostgreSQL for metadata
- **Hardware**: RTL-SDR, HackRF One, HackRF H4M, LimeSDR Mini (via SoapySDR bridge)

## Core Components

### Device Support
- Multiple SDR device support (RTL-SDR, HackRF, etc.)
- Concurrent device operation with role assignment
- Device status monitoring and management

### Signal Processing
- Frequency scanning with threshold detection
- Real-time FFT analysis and burst detection
- IQ recording and playback capabilities

### User Interface
- React-based web interface with Tailwind styling
- Live spectrum and waterfall displays
- Signal event logging and visualization
- Burst browser with tagging and metadata

### API Layer
- FastAPI-based REST endpoints
- WebSocket real-time communication
- Export capabilities to external tools

### ML Integration (Future)
- Signal classification and modulation detection
- Protocol analysis and decoding workflows

## Documentation
- Product requirements: [docs/PRD.md](mdc:docs/PRD.md)
